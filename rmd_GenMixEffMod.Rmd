# Microscopy Data

* cells were stained for centromeric marker
* outcome: number of centromeric clusters (counts)
* conditions: Target vs. Control RNAi
* replicate: experimental day
* 4 microscopy slides in total
* cells are not independent on the same slide

```{r, }
# insert data
dat <- data.frame(experiment = rep(c("day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day2", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1", "day1"),2),
                 RNAi = rep(c("Control", "Target"), each = 100),
                 counts = c(6, 6, 4, 6, 3, 5, 10, 9, 5, 4, 8, 4, 9, 7, 7, 2, 6, 9, 4, 3, 5, 4, 4, 2, 8, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 7, 4, 6, 3, 3, 3, 7, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 5, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 7, 5, 4, 6, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 2, 5, 4, 5, 4, 6, 10, 5, 6, 4, 11, 3, 13, 3, 6, 3, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 6, 4, 11, 5, 4, 5, 1, 2, 4, 16, 6, 9, 7, 11, 12, 6, 3, 7, 8, 8, 12, 7, 9, 5, 9, 5, 10, 7, 6, 7, 19, 3, 13, 7, 6, 13, 8, 8, 11, 7, 13, 10, 6, 4, 13, 3, 4, 2, 10, 6, 8, 6, 9, 9, 5, 4, 20, 2, 5, 7, 5, 10, 4, 7, 5, 6, 3, 4, 7, 9, 8, 16, 6, 10, 8, 5, 6, 4, 11, 6, 2, 6, 8, 11, 6, 5, 8, 8, 7, 10, 9, 7, 4, 6, 8, 2, 10, 7, 8, 3, 4, 10, 13, 6, 12, 8, 1, 5, 6))

# group for each slide
dat$slide <- factor(paste(dat$RNAi, dat$experiment, sep = "_"))

# relevel RNAi
dat$RNAi <- relevel(dat$RNAi, ref = "Control")

# check factor levels
str(dat)

# simple summary
summary(dat)

# Data Visualization

* visualization of the datapoints (beeswarm) and boxplot
* effect looks 'clear' by eye
* it does not look normally distributed (also tied values)
* variance does not look homogeneous

```{r, fig.align="center"}
library(beeswarm)
boxplot(counts ~ slide, data = dat, ylim = c(0,20))
beeswarm(counts ~ slide, data = dat, pch=19, col="#00000088", add = TRUE)
```



---

# Data Distribution

* inspecting data distribution by qqplot
* Poisson and negative binomial looks better

```{r, message=FALSE, results=F, warning=F, fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
library(car)
library(MASS)

par(mfrow = c(1,4), cex=1.1)
attach(dat)

# normal distribution (it does not look "normal")
qqp(counts, "norm", pch = 20)

# lognormal distribution
qqp(counts, "lnorm", pch = 20)

# Poisson distribution
poisson <- fitdistr(counts, "Poisson")
qqp(counts, "pois", lambda = poisson$estimate, pch = 20)

# negative binomial distribution (Poisson + overdispersion)
negbinom <- fitdistr(counts, "negative binomial")
qqp(counts, "nbinom", size = negbinom$estimate[1], mu = negbinom$estimate[2], pch = 20)
```


# Mixed Effect models

* the model contains fixed and random effects
* beta - vector of fixed effects
* u - vector of random effects
* formula:

### MASS glmmPQL

* fit a glmm 
* fixed effect: RNAi (treatment)
* random intercept: slide (groups)
* negative binomial family


```{r}
# fit a fixed effect glm for estimating theta (dispersion) parameter
glm_fixed <- glm.nb(counts ~ RNAi, data = dat)
theta <- glm_fixed$theta

# use theta in glmm
glmm <- glmmPQL(counts ~ RNAi, random = ~1|slide, data = dat, family = negative.binomial(link = "log", theta = theta))
summary(glmm)
```

<br />

* get means by exponentiation

```{r}
library(nlme)
as.numeric(c(exp(fixed.effects(glmm))[1], 
             exp(fixed.effects(glmm))[1] * exp(fixed.effects(glmm))[2]))
```

* Conclusion: Target RNAi significantly increases the number of centromeric clusters 
* Mean difference: ~2.5, p-value: ~0.03, n of experiments: 2, n of cells: 200

---

### Subsampling

* check whether number of observations (cells) influence results
* subsample (half) and replicate 100x for obtaining p-values

```{r}

pvals <- replicate(n = 100, expr = {
              
dat_sub <- dat[sample(1:200, size = 100),]

glmm_sub <- glmmPQL(counts ~ RNAi, random = ~1|slide, data = dat_sub, family = negative.binomial(link = "log", theta = theta),
                      verbose = F)
coef(summary(glmm_sub))[2,5]
})

summary(pvals)
```
<br />

* Conclusion: the number of cells has an influence but not so dramatic
* it would be interesting to see how more replicates (exp. days) would change results
